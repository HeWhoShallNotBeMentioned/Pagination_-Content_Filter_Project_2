# _{Pagination_&_Content_Filter_Project_2}_

#### _{Brief description of application}, {11/8/2016}_

#### By _**{Chris Underwood}**_

## Description

_{ Using vanilla JS only, pagination is dynamically placed on the screen. The software is build to support and undetermined number of students with one page per 10 students and one additional page if there are students left over but less than ten. A search box is also dynamically placed on the screen that searches for user name and email on keyup. a message is displayed on the screen if there are no matching items in the search. I am trying to get the pagination buttons to highlight when they are active but the unhighlighting is proving difficult  }_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

Download the files and open the index.html file in the browser of your choice.

## Known Bugs

_{The previously mentioned highlighting of pagination buttons. Whenm in the search box and after I have no users meeting the criteria, you will need to refresh the page or click on a page number to "reset" the program.  When using the search box, when the program is returning users I am receiving an error in the console that my code to remove the message div is giving an error (Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'remove' of undefine). The code appears to be working fine for the user.}_
